# LinkedLists
Author: Sammy Burns

This java project is a coding of the linked lists method. The code properly declares a linked list and is able to insert elements, delete elements, and search for elements. The Element class creates an Element object, which holds an integer value and points to two other elements, the previous element and the next element. The first element, or the head sets the previous element as null, and for the end element, the next element will remain null. The element has get and set methods. The LinkedLists class creates, well... a linked list, with the methods stated earlier, insert, delete, and search. The main class is for testing of the various different methods. While making this code, I struggled with the logic of insert method, especially with comprehension of setting elements to have a next element, which do not exist at the time of exectuion of the code. For parts of the code, like the insert logic, I used the providen video instructions.
